## Notes

- The Linux artifact is a single-file binary; ensure it is executable (`chmod +x`).
- Linux builds should be produced on a case-sensitive filesystem (ext4) to avoid Python extension casing issues at runtime.
- Android client `axebench_client_v1.2.apk`: verify it matches `checksums/v3.0.0.sha256` (older uploads may not).

## Known Issues (v3.0.0)

- Pool scheduling could be unreliable in some configurations (fallback fields not recognized consistently and/or stale default pool selection). v3.0.1_ALPHA includes scheduler reliability fixes.
