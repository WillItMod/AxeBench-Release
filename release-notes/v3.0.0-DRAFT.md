# AxeBench v3.0.0 (DRAFT - pending testing)

This is a staging note for the upcoming **v3.0.0** release. Do not treat as final until testing completes and the GitHub Release is published.

## Artifacts (local staging)

- Windows: `AxeBench_v3.0.0.exe`
- Linux: `AxeBench_v3.0.0_linux.bin`
- Android client: `axebench_client_v1.2.apk`

Checksums (for staged artifacts):

- `checksums/v3.0.0-DRAFT.sha256`

## Notes

- Linux builds should be produced on a case-sensitive filesystem (ext4) to avoid Python extension casing issues at runtime.
