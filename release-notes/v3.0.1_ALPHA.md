## Highlights

- **Canaan Avalon Nano 3S support** (monitoring + pool management + scheduling).
- Nano 3S preset profiles map to the device work modes: Low (Quiet), Med (Balanced), High (Max).
- Pool scheduler reliability improvements (correct pool/fallback selection + activation).

## Nano 3S Notes

- Nano 3S is treated as **monitoring + pool-managed only** in AxeBench (no voltage/frequency tuning without custom firmware).
- Pool URLs must include the full prefix (example): `stratum+tcp://host:port`.
- If pool settings appear to “save but not activate”, the device may require a reboot to apply; AxeBench now triggers the correct reboot action automatically when scheduling changes.

## Known Issues

- Some Nano 3S metrics shown in the web UI are averaged over longer windows than BitAxes; expect small differences between “real-time” and “average” values depending on refresh timing.
